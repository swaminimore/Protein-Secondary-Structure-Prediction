# Protein-Secondary-Structure-Prediction
This repository contains code and resources for residue-level protein secondary structure prediction using deep learning. The project trains and evaluates a convolutional neural network (CNN) on large-scale benchmarks (CullPDB for training; CB513 for testing) and achieves high Q3 accuracy for helix, sheet, and coil classification.
